## you can set other regex patterns here such as :
## ^(feature|fix|hotfix|release)/.+ - branch has to start with feature/, fix/, release/ or hotfix/
## (feature|release|hotfix)/(JIRA-\d+) - it should look like feature/JIRA-1234
## (feature|release|hotfix)/(JIRA-\d+/)?[a-z-]+ - it should look like feature/branch-name or include JIRA's code like feature/JIRA-1234/branch-name
